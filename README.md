# postgresql-basics
postgresql is the database that we are using to store the values from the API.

## setup postgresql
we pull the database from the docker and run the database in the dbeaver.
- first, install the docker and postgresql
- then, docker pull postgres

## postgres setup in docker
- create the container to run postgres
- start the container
- run the container
- start the postgres using the command 'psql -U postgres'

## Create Database
- To create database, `CREATE DATABASE instaclone`
- To connect the database, `\c instaclone`
- Now, add the database in the dbeaver, with the instaclone database name.
- In this database, we are going to create the tables for users, posts, likes.
- To create users table, `CREATE TABLE users(userid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, username VARCHAR NOT NULL);`
- To create posts table, `CREATE TABLE posts(postid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, postcontent VARCHAR NOT NULL, postdate DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE, userid SERIAL REFERENCES users(userid));`
- To create likes table, `CREATE TABLE likes(likeid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, postid SERIAL REFERENCES posts(postid),userid SERIAL REFERENCES users(userid))`
- To insert the information into the table use the command,
  - `INSERT INTO users(username) VALUES('Edina'),('Colin'),('Glenda'),('Paula')`
  - 1-Edina, 2-Colin, 3-Glenda, 4-Paula
  - `INSERT INTO posts(postcontent, userid) VALUES('craft',1),('sale',1),('design',1),('tips',1),('lesson',1)`
  - 1-Crafts-1, 2-sale-1, 3-design, 4-tips, 5-lesson, 6-animal, 7-cartoon, 8-gift, 9-meme, 10-craft, 11-forest, 12-bikesale, 13-book, 14-award, 15-comedy, 16-gold, 17-awarness, 18-Experiments, 19-landsale, 20-tricks.
  - `INSERT INTO likes(postid, userid) VALUES(13, 3),(13,4),(13,1),(13,3),(14,1),(14,2),(15,4),(15,2),(17,3),(17,1),(19,3),(19,2),(1,4),(1,3),(4,3),(4,4),(4,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,1),(7,2),(8,4),(8,1),(9,4),(9,1),(9,3)`

## SQL scripts
- SQL scripts are sets of SQL (Structured Query Language) statements that are executed to perform various operations on a relational database. They provide a structured and automated way to make changes to the database schema, manipulate data, control access, and ensure the consistency and integrity of the database.
- There are three main types of SQL scripts are:

  - DDL (Data Definition Language):
    CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc.
  - DML (Data Manipulation Language):
    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
  - DCL (Data Control Language):
    GRANT, REVOKE, etc.
    
### DDL commands

1. `CREATE DATABASE instaclone`
2. `\c instaclone`
3. `CREATE TABLE users(userid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, username VARCHAR NOT NULL);`
4. `CREATE TABLE posts(postid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, postcontent VARCHAR NOT NULL, postdate DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE, userid SERIAL REFERENCES users(userid));`
5. `CREATE TABLE likes(likeid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, postid SERIAL REFERENCES posts(postid),userid SERIAL REFERENCES users(userid))`
6. `INSERT INTO users(username) VALUES('Edina'),('Colin'),('Glenda'),('Paula')`
7. `INSERT INTO posts(postcontent, userid) VALUES('craft',1),('sale',1),('design',1),('tips',1),('lesson',1)`
8. `INSERT INTO likes(postid, userid) VALUES(13, 3),(13,4),(13,1),(13,3),(14,1),(14,2),(15,4),(15,2),(17,3),(17,1),(19,3),(19,2),(1,4),(1,3),(4,3),(4,4),(4,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,1),(7,2),(8,4),(8,1),(9,4),(9,1),(9,3)`

### DML commands
```
1. SELECT * from users;
2. SELECT * from posts;
3. select posts.postcontent as likedByColin from posts left join likes on posts.postid = likes.postid where likes.userid = 2;
4. select users.username as liked_glenda_post from users inner join likes on users.userid=likes.userid where likes.postid=13;
5. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.postid) FROM posts inner join likes on posts.postid=likes.postid where posts.userid = 1;
6. SELECT COUNT(likes.likeid)
FROM likes where likes.postid = 17 or likes.postid=20;
7. SELECT COUNT(likes.likeid)
FROM likes where likes.postid = 17 or likes.postid=19;
8. SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE posts.postcontent ILIKE '%sal%';
9. SELECT COUNT(posts.postid) AS no_of_colin_post FROM posts
WHERE  posts.userid=2;
10. select COUNT(likes.likeid) AS cartoon_likes from likes where likes.postid = 7;
11. select postid, count(postid) from likes GROUP BY postid HAVING COUNT(postid)>1 order by count(postid) desc limit 2;
12. select * from posts where userid=1 ORDER BY postcontent;
13. select * from posts where userid=4 ORDER BY postdate DESC;
14. select * from posts where postdate= 'today';
```
## Data Querying DML

1. list all users `SELECT * from users;`
```
instaclone=# SELECT * from users;
